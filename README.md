# DotNetMicroservices

In this project I did an introduction on building microservices using .NET 5. 
As the name suggests I built everything completely from start to finish. However, at a high-level I covered:

• Building two .NET Microservices using the REST API pattern
• Working with dedicated persistence layers for both services
• Deploying our services to Kubernetes cluster
• Employing the API Gateway pattern to route to our services
• Building Synchronous messaging between services (HTTP & gRPC)
• Building Asynchronous messaging between services using an Event Bus (RabbitMQ)
